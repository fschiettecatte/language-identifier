Language Identifier:
====================

Simple language identifier which allows you to create language ngrams from source
text in a variety of languages, and then identify the langiage of a piece of text.

I used the TextCat source texts for the ngram files, but you could just as easily
use the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as source text.

I wrote this in Perl about 4 years ago for another project, and decided to port it 
to Python and release it. I have kept the code very simple so it should port easily
to other languages (I have already ported it to Java.)


Directories:
------------

- ./textcat.texts - contains the source text
- ./textcat.ngrams - contains the ngram files
